    "description": "I have always dreamt of developing video-games, with full creative control over the entire project. In the beginning of 2024, I started to learn game development as a hobby. I started with Unity, and eventually made my way to Unreal Engine, while working on various projects with the engines to build up my skills. I am picking up skills in everything from game mechanics and level/environement design, to sound design and writing. I am currently in the early stages of developing a large game project (more info to come).",
