  "introduction": "I am an Aerospace Engineering Graduate from Toronto Metropolitan University, currently working as a Business Analyst in Tech. Space and everything extraterrestrial was fascinating to me from early childhood and throughout my High School years. This interest soon evolved into the unavoidable career choice towards Science & Engineering. A mutlidisciplinary environement in academia exposed me to various technical and non-technical subjects (including everything from Orbital Mechanics and Spacecraft Design, to Systems Engineering and Project Management). I developed a passion for Software Engineering during these years, especially within the realms of Artifical Intelligence, Game Development, and Low-level-programming. I am fascinated by innovation, and I look foward to working at the frontier of engineering and technology."
