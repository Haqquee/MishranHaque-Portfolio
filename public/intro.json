  "introduction": "Hello! I am Mishran, an Aerospace Engineering Graduate from Toronto Metropolitan University (Formerly Ryerson University). Space and everything extraterrestrial was fascinating to me from early childhood and throughout my High School years. This interest soon evolved into the unavoidable career choice towards Science & Engineering. My passion for space travel and state-of-the-art vehicles eventually led me to join the Aerospace Engineering Program at Ryerson University. Over my four years of University, I got to take various courses that strengthened my knowledge of aerospace applications. I got the opportunity to work with Design teams such as Ryerson Rocketry Club and Ryerson Propulsion Group and experience the process behind designing and building a supersonic rocket. In 2022, I spent 3 Co-op terms with the Canadian Space Agency where I held Project Management and Mechanical Engineering Positions within three different project teams. During my years at University, I developed a passion for Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence. Writing code and developing meaningful software became a hobby for me. This led me to obtain a Minor in Computer Science where I took courses and completed projects mainly related to Low-level Programming and Machine Learning. These experiences and coursework allowed me to develop skills in programming using Python, C, and C++, as well as Machine Learning Frameworks and Libraries. I am always open to new professional connections and meaningful conversations!"
