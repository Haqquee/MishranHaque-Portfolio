# Personal Portfolio Website

A personal website showcasing, projects and experiences. Created with Next.js and Tailwind CSS. There is more content I would like to add to the site, so I will keep updating it as I go.


## How to run it locally

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
